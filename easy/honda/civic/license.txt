A customized Honda Civic Type-R 2024 Edition, done in Blender 3D, made upon another model: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/2024-honda-civic-type-r-fb35ab79436b4805a46049d83bcf7c40

Can use in any personal projects. Can use commercially.

The windshield is a little messed up. I will fix it as soon as possible.
